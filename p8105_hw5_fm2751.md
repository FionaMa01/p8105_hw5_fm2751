## Problem 0

## Problem 1

The code chunk below imports the data in individual spreadsheets
contained in `./data/zip_data/`. To do this, I create a dataframe that
includes the list of all files in that directory and the complete path
to each file. As a next step, I `map` over paths and import data using
the `read_csv` function. Finally, I `unnest` the result of `map`.

``` r
full_df = 
  tibble(
    files = list.files("data/zip_data/"),
    path = str_c("data/zip_data/", files)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(path, read_csv)) %>% 
  unnest()
```

The result of the previous code chunk isn’t tidy – data are wide rather
than long, and some important variables are included as parts of others.
The code chunk below tides the data using string manipulations on the
file, converting from wide to long, and selecting relevant variables.

``` r
tidy_df = 
  full_df %>% 
  mutate(
    files = str_replace(files, ".csv", ""),
    group = str_sub(files, 1, 3)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "outcome",
    names_prefix = "week_") %>% 
  mutate(week = as.numeric(week)) %>% 
  select(group, subj = files, week, outcome)
```

Finally, the code chunk below creates a plot showing individual data,
faceted by group.

``` r
tidy_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = outcome, group = subj, color = group)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_path() + 
  facet_grid(~group)
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_fm2751_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

This plot suggests high within-subject correlation – subjects who start
above average end up above average, and those that start below average
end up below average. Subjects in the control group generally don’t
change over time, but those in the experiment group increase their
outcome in a roughly linear way.

## Problem 2

### Describe the raw data

``` r
homicide = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")

summary(homicide)
```

This raw dataset contains 52179 observations and 12 variables, they are
’uid, reported_date, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age,
victim_sex, city, state, lat, lon, disposition. Data on homicides were
collected in 50 large U.S. cities. The earliest reported date is
2007/01/01.

### Create variables

``` r
homicide_df = 
  homicide %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ",", state),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    )) %>% 
  relocate(city_state) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution)

head(homicide_df, 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 2
    ##    city_state     resolution
    ##    <chr>          <chr>     
    ##  1 Albuquerque,NM unsolved  
    ##  2 Albuquerque,NM solved    
    ##  3 Albuquerque,NM unsolved  
    ##  4 Albuquerque,NM solved    
    ##  5 Albuquerque,NM unsolved  
    ##  6 Albuquerque,NM unsolved  
    ##  7 Albuquerque,NM solved    
    ##  8 Albuquerque,NM solved    
    ##  9 Albuquerque,NM unsolved  
    ## 10 Albuquerque,NM unsolved

### Summarize

``` r
homicide_summary =
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    homicide_total = n(),
    homicide_unsolved = sum(resolution == "unsolved")
    )

homicide_summary %>% 
  knitr::kable()
